# CArchitecture_Tester_Ass3
A tester that I have written for assignment 3 of the Computer Architecture class in BGU 2021

This tester generates random data on the fly and then tests different scenarios on your generated executable. Output from the executable is compared to the correct output.
Very useful for those who don't wanna do things manual. (This allows thousands of randomly generated tests in minutes)
